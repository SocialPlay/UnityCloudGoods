Welcome To The Cloud Goods SDK. We have set up a few scenes for you to demonstrate how easy it is to implement and use the Cloud Goods SDK in any of your games. Each scene demonstrates a specific feature that has prefabs that you can also use in scenes in your game in a few easy steps.

1. Socialplay Login

This scene demonstrates user persistency manangement. You can use the auto created account that was given when you had registered on the Socialplay Developer Portal. If you have not yet registered on the developer portal, Create an account at developer.socialplay.com
You can also register a new user by clicking the register button. You will have to give a valid email, and create a password and username. Once your new user has been successfully registered, you will have to check your email for an authentication email to activated your newly created user.
If at any time you forget your user's password, you can enter your users email in the email field, then click on the forgot password button. It should send an email to that user to prompt a password reset. There are various events that can be hooked onto for this system, and CloudsGoodsSDK makes it easy for
developers to integrate their game with the login system.

2. Item Containers And Generation

This scene demonstrates one of our main features of the Cloud Goods SDK which allows developers to display and manage the users items. It also demonstrates a way that the game can give users items in a point and click method. There are a few key components 
in the item container part of this scene that developers will notice and can implement on their own or use the templated prefabs given with the SDK
