## Cloud Goods

Cloud Goods is a service which makes adding items and a store into your Unity game a snap. It allows your game to start generating Virtual Goods revenue quickly and painlessly. It also introduces Shared Virtual Goods: the ability to share items between your games (Imagine a mobile mini game that lets players collect resources they can use in the full desktop game).
